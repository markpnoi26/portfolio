  about_me: "I am a programmer and a scientist, I have a background in chemistry and have been working as a Senior Chemist for a number of years. I have a constant hunger for learning new things in the tech and science space. Both fields are very fun for me to explore. With the combination of both, I am able to really tackle problems from a technical standpoint as well as from a creative mindset.",
  interest: "I love snowboarding, and also love spending my time indoors. Sunny or rainy, you will usually find me satisfied and happy with life. Very few things bring me down. I love spending time with my wife, and doing a lot of traveling with her. I personally do not enjoy traveling much, but with her it's very easy and she makes me want to be more adventurous. I love technology and how it has advanced our lives. I intend to be a part of this movement, while combining my love for both science and technology."
